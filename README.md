### Setting Up `PYTHONPATH`

To ensure that Python can properly locate the modules within this project, you should add the project's root directory to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. This can be done by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.), depending on your operating system:

#### On Linux or macOS:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Edit your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
   or for zsh:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```
3. Add the following line at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/REPLACE/THIS/PATH/ikt450/"
   ```
4. Save and close the file.
5. Apply the changes by sourcing the file:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
   or for zsh:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

#### On Windows:
1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
2. Set the `PYTHONPATH` for your session:
   ```cmd
   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\REPLACE\THIS\PATH\ikt450\
   ```
3. To set it permanently, use the `setx` command:
   ```cmd
   setx PYTHONPATH "%PYTHONPATH%;C:\REPLACE\THIS\PATH\ikt450\"
   ```
