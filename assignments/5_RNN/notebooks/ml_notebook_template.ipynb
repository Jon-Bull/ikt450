       " 'title: how to implement a decorator with non-local equality?\\nbody: <p>greetings, currently i am refactoring one of my programs, and i found an interesting problem.</p>\\n\\n<p>i have transitions in an automata. transitions always have a start-state and an end-state. some transitions have a label, which encodes a certain action that must be performed upon traversal. no label means no action. some transitions have a condition, which must be fulfilled in order to traverse this condition, if there is no condition, the transition is basically an epsilon-transition in an nfa and will be traversed without consuming an input symbol.</p>\\n\\n<p>i need the following operations:  </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>check if the transition has a label</li>\\n<li>get this label</li>\\n<li>add a label to a transition</li>\\n<li>check if the transition has a condition </li>\\n<li>get this condition</li>\\n<li>check for equality</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>judging from the first five points, this sounds like a clear decorator, with a base transition and two decorators: labeled and condition. however, this approach has a problem: two transitions are considered equal if their start-state and end-state are the same, the labels at both transitions are equal (or not-existing) and both conditions are the same (or not existing). with a decorator, i might have two transitions labeled(\"foo\", conditional(\"bar\", transition(\"baz\", \"qux\"))) and conditional(\"bar\", labeled(\"foo\", transition(\"baz\", \"qux\"))) which need a non-local equality, that is, the decorators would need to collect all the data and the transition must compare this collected data on a set-base:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class transition(object):\\n    def __init__(self, start, end):\\n        self.start = start\\n        self.end = end\\n    def get_label(self):\\n        return none\\n    def has_label(self):\\n        return false\\n    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):\\n        return decorations\\n    def internal_equality(self, my_decorations, other):\\n        try:\\n            return (self.start == other.start\\n                    and self.end == other.end\\n                    and my_decorations = other.collect_decorations())\\n    def __eq__(self, other):\\n        return self.internal_equality(self.collect_decorations({}), other)\\n\\nclass labeled(object):\\n    def __init__(self, label, base):\\n        self.base = base\\n        self.label = label\\n    def has_label(self):\\n        return true\\n    def get_label(self):\\n        return self.label\\n    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):\\n        assert \\'label\\' not in decorations\\n        decorations[\\'label\\'] = self.label\\n        return self.base.collect_decorations(decorations)\\n    def __getattr__(self, attribute):\\n        return self.base.__getattr(attribute)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>is this a clean approach?
